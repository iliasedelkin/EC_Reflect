# Reflections
## App for daily reflections on your life

We are Academy Heroes and this is our app. It was created to test various SwiftUI features such as CoreData, Networking, Authorization, Entities. We also learn how to use Git Workflows.

The app allows our users write down reflections on each day and tag it with an emoji that sums up emotions throughout the day. An inspirational quote is shown on a start screen and it updates on launch or at user request. 

This README will be updated along the development of this app.
